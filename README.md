## Reporting a Bug
Keep in mind the following instructions when reporting a bug:
* Describe the bug: the better you describe the problem, the easier it is for me to reproduce it. Screenshots are very welcome.
* Describe what happened vs. what you expected: this makes it clear to me what you think went wrong and the issue can be resolved faster.
* Explain what you were doing when you encountered the bug: this gives me a clear list of steps to reproduce the bug.
* List what version you were using: there's no point in chasing a bug that may have already been fixed.
* In general, include as much information as you can: the less questions need to be asked, the faster the bug will be fixed.

Following these instructions will ensure that I am able to reproduce and fix the bug.
